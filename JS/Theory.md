What is a closure?
What is the difference between a promise and a callback?

## Explain the this keyword in JavaScript.
A function's this keyword behaves a little differently in JavaScript compared to other languages. It also has some differences between strict mode and non-strict mode.

In nonâ€“strict mode, this is always a reference to an object. In strict mode, it can be any value. In non-strict mode, a special process called this substitution ensures that the value of this is always an object. 

The value of this depends on in which context it appears: function, class, or global.

**Function context**:
Think about this as a hidden parameter of a function.

```js
function getThis() {
  return this;
}

const obj1 = { name: "obj1" };
const obj2 = { name: "obj2" };

obj1.getThis = getThis;
obj2.getThis = getThis;

console.log(obj1.getThis()); // { name: 'obj1', getThis: [Function: getThis] }
console.log(obj2.getThis()); // { name: 'obj2', getThis: [Function: getThis] }

```

The value of this is not the object that has the function as an own property, but the object that is used to call the function. 

```js
const obj3 = {
  __proto__: obj1,
  name: "obj3",
};console.log(obj3.getThis()); // { name: 'obj3' }
```

**Class context**
A class can be split into two contexts: static and instance. Static methods are not properties of this. They are properties of the class itself.

```js
class C {
  instanceField = this;
  static staticField = this;
}

const c = new C();
console.log(c.instanceField === c); // true
console.log(C.staticField === C); // true

```

**Global context**
```js
// In web browsers, the window object is also the global object:
console.log(this === window); // true

this.b = "MDN";console.log(window.b); // "MDN"console.log(b); // "MDN"
```

## Prototype
Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.

If you type the object's name followed by a period into the console, like myObject., then the console will pop up a list of all the properties available to this object. You'll see that as well as city and greet, there are lots of other properties!

```
__defineGetter__
__defineSetter__
__lookupGetter__
__lookupSetter__
__proto__
city
constructor
greet
hasOwnProperty
isPrototypeOf
propertyIsEnumerable
toLocaleString
toString
valueOf
```

Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.

What is the prototype for myObject? To find out, we can use the function Object.getPrototypeOf():
```
Object.getPrototypeOf(myObject); // Object { }
```

**Shadowing properties**
```js
const myDate = new Date(1995, 11, 17);

console.log(myDate.getYear()); // 95

myDate.getYear = function () {
  console.log("something else!");
};

myDate.getYear(); // 'something else!'
```

**Setting a prototype**
1. Using Object.create
```js
const personPrototype = {
  greet() {
    console.log("hello!");
  },
};

const carl = Object.create(personPrototype);
carl.greet(); // hello!
```

2. Using a constructor
Object.assign(Person.prototype, personPrototype);

## closures
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

```js
function makeFunc() {
  const name = "Mozilla";
  function displayName() {
    console.log(name);
  }
  return displayName;
}

const myFunc = makeFunc();
myFunc();
```
This works and the reason is that functions in JavaScript form closures. A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. 

For instance, suppose we want to add buttons to a page to adjust the text size. 
```js
function makeSizer(size) {
  return function () {
    document.body.style.fontSize = `${size}px`;
  };
}

const size12 = makeSizer(12);
const size14 = makeSizer(14);
const size16 = makeSizer(16);
```
```js
document.getElementById("size-12").onclick = size12;
document.getElementById("size-14").onclick = size14;
document.getElementById("size-16").onclick = size16;
```

**Emulating private methods with closures**
```js
const counter = (function () {
  let privateCounter = 0;
  function changeBy(val) {
    privateCounter += val;
  }

  return {
    increment() {
      changeBy(1);
    },

    decrement() {
      changeBy(-1);
    },

    value() {
      return privateCounter;
    },
  };
})();

console.log(counter.value()); // 0.

counter.increment();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.value()); // 2.

counter.decrement();
console.log(counter.value()); // 1.
```

**Closure scope chain**
```js
// global scope
const e = 10;
function sum(a) {
  return function sum2(b) {
    return function sum3(c) {
      // outer functions scope
      return function sum4(d) {
        // local scope
        return a + b + c + d + e;
      };
    };
  };
}

const sum2 = sum(1);
const sum3 = sum2(2);
const sum4 = sum3(3);
const result = sum4(4);
console.log(result); // 20
```

## Async-style code
Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished. 

Many functions provided by browsers, especially the most interesting ones, can potentially take a long time, and therefore, are asynchronous. For example:

1. Making HTTP requests using fetch()
2. Accessing a user's camera or microphone using getUserMedia()
3. Asking a user to select files using showOpenFilePicker()

You'll find that while our generatePrimes() function is running, our program is completely unresponsive: you can't type anything, click anything, or do anything else.
This is the basic problem with long-running synchronous functions. What we need is a way for our program to:

1. Start a long-running operation by calling a function.
2. Have that function start the operation and return immediately, so that our program can still be responsive to other events.
3. Notify us with the result of the operation when it eventually completes.

That's precisely what asynchronous functions can do. The rest of this module explains how they are implemented in JavaScript.

**Event handlers**
The description we just saw of asynchronous functions might remind you of event handlers, and if it does, you'd be right. You provide a function (the event handler) that will be called, not right away, but whenever the event happens. 

The following example shows this in action. Press "Click to start request" to send a request. We create a new XMLHttpRequest and listen for its loadend event. The handler logs a "Finished!" message along with the status code.

After adding the event listener we send the request. Note that after this, we can log "Started XHR request": that is, our program can continue to run while the request is going on, and our event handler will be called when the request is complete.

```html
<button id="xhr">Click to start request</button>
<button id="reload">Reload</button>

<pre readonly class="event-log"></pre>
```

```js
const log = document.querySelector(".event-log");

document.querySelector("#xhr").addEventListener("click", () => {
  log.textContent = "";

  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

  xhr.addEventListener("loadend", () => {
    log.textContent = `${log.textContent}Finished with status: ${xhr.status}`;
  });

  xhr.open(
    "GET",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/content/main/files/en-us/_wikihistory.json",
  );
  xhr.send();
  log.textContent = `${log.textContent}Started XHR request\n`;
});

document.querySelector("#reload").addEventListener("click", () => {
  log.textContent = "";
  document.location.reload();
});
```

**Callbacks**
An event handler is a particular type of callback. A callback is just a function that's passed into another function, with the expectation that the callback will be called at the appropriate time. 

without callback
```js
function doStep1(init) {
  return init + 1;
}

function doStep2(init) {
  return init + 2;
}

function doStep3(init) {
  return init + 3;
}

function doOperation() {
  let result = 0;
  result = doStep1(result);
  result = doStep2(result);
  result = doStep3(result);
  console.log(`result: ${result}`);
}

doOperation();
```

```js
function doStep1(init, callback) {
  const result = init + 1;
  callback(result);
}

function doStep2(init, callback) {
  const result = init + 2;
  callback(result);
}

function doStep3(init, callback) {
  const result = init + 3;
  callback(result);
}

function doOperation() {
  doStep1(0, (result1) => {
    doStep2(result1, (result2) => {
      doStep3(result2, (result3) => {
        console.log(`result: ${result3}`);
      });
    });
  });
}

doOperation();
```
Because we have to call callbacks inside callbacks, we get a deeply nested doOperation() function, which is much harder to read and debug. This is sometimes called "callback hell" or the "pyramid of doom".

## Promise
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function. 

Promises solves many problems like:

**Chaining**

A common need is to execute two or more asynchronous operations back to back, where each subsequent operation starts when the previous operation succeeds, with the result from the previous step.

doSomething()
  .then((result) => doSomethingElse(result))
  .then((newResult) => doThirdThing(newResult))
  .then((finalResult) => {
    console.log(`Got the final result: ${finalResult}`);
  })
  .catch(failureCallback);

as a rule of thumb, whenever your operation encounters a promise, return it and defer its handling to the next then handler.

**Nesting**
```js
doSomethingCritical()
  .then((result) =>
    doSomethingOptional(result)
      .then((optionalResult) => doSomethingExtraNice(optionalResult))
      .catch((e) => {}),
  ) // Ignore if optional stuff fails; proceed.
  .then(() => moreCriticalStuff())
  .catch((e) => console.error(`Critical failure: ${e.message}`));
```

**Chaining after a catch**
```js
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  console.log("Initial");

  resolve();
})
  .then(() => {
    throw new Error("Something failed");

    console.log("Do this");
  })
  .catch(() => {
    console.error("Do that");
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Do this, no matter what happened before");
  });
```
Output
```
Initial
Do that
Do this, no matter what happened before
```

This is very much modeled after how synchronous code works:
```js
try {
  const result = syncDoSomething();
  const newResult = syncDoSomethingElse(result);
  const finalResult = syncDoThirdThing(newResult);
  console.log(`Got the final result: ${finalResult}`);
} catch (error) {
  failureCallback(error);
}
```

This symmetry with asynchronous code culminates in the async/await syntax:
```js
async function foo() {
  try {
    const result = await doSomething();
    const newResult = await doSomethingElse(result);
    const finalResult = await doThirdThing(newResult);
    console.log(`Got the final result: ${finalResult}`);
  } catch (error) {
    failureCallback(error);
  }
}
```
